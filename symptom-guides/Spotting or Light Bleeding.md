# Spotting or Light Bleeding

## Why it happens
Spotting is very common in the first trimester. It may be related to implantation, or minor irritation of the cervix from increased blood flow after intercourse or pelvic exams.

## When to call your doctor
If the bleeding is heavy (soaking a pad in an hour), bright red, or accompanied by severe abdominal pain.
