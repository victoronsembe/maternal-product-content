# Light Cramping (Round Ligament Pain)

## Why it happens
Your uterus is expanding and stretching the surrounding ligaments (called the round ligaments). This often feels like a quick, sharp pain when you change positions or a dull ache.

## When to call your doctor
If the cramping is severe, constant, or accompanied by heavy, bright red bleeding (more than a menstrual period).
