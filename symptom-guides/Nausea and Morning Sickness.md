# Nausea and Morning Sickness

## Why it happens
This is widely believed to be caused by the rapid rise of the Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) hormone, a crucial hormone that signals your body to support the pregnancy. It's often a sign of a healthy, progressing pregnancy.

## When to call your doctor
If you are unable to keep any food or liquids down for a full 24 hours, or if you are losing weight rapidly.
