# Bloating

## Why it happens
Progesterone relaxes the smooth muscles throughout your body, including those in your digestive tract. This slows down digestion to maximize nutrient absorption, leading to gas and that 'heavy' feeling.

## When to call your doctor
If bloating is accompanied by sudden, severe abdominal pain that doesn't pass, or if you haven't had a bowel movement in several days.
