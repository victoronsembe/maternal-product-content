# Fatigue

## Why it happens
Your body is working overtime to build the placenta (a new organ!) and is flooded with high levels of progesterone, which acts like a strong natural sedative.

## When to call your doctor
If the fatigue is so severe that it prevents you from functioning, or if it is accompanied by extreme paleness or a racing heartbeat, as this could signal anemia or other issues.
