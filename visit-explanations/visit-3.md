# Visit 3 (Around 16 Weeks): Early Second Trimester Check-in

## Purpose
To begin monitoring the physical growth of your uterus and confirm that you are settling into the "golden weeks" of pregnancy.

## What Happens
The provider will likely check your fundal height (measuring your belly) and listen for the baby's heartbeat using a Doppler. Since you often feel much better now, the focus shifts to preparing for your anatomy scan and enjoying the reduced symptoms.
