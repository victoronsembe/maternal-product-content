# Maternal Health Monitoring App: MVP Microcopy and UX Text

**Goal:** To establish a supportive, non-clinical, and reassuring voice in all application text, promoting daily check-ins and reducing user anxiety.

## 1. Onboarding & Registration Copy

| UI Element | Copy Text | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
