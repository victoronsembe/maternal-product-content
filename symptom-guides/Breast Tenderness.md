# Breast Tenderness

## Why it happens
Hormones are preparing your mammary glands for breastfeeding almost immediately after conception, causing the milk ducts to grow and the breast tissue to become sensitive and swollen.

## When to call your doctor
If you notice a painful, firm lump that does not go away, or if there is unusual colored discharge (other than clear or milky).
