# Food Aversions

## Why it happens
Your sense of smell and taste is heightened by hormones (especially estrogen), making certain smells or flavors intolerable. This is thought to be a protective mechanism to keep you away from potentially harmful foods.

## When to call your doctor
If the aversions are so severe that you are unable to eat anything from a major food group (like protein) for more than a few days, or if you notice rapid weight loss.
