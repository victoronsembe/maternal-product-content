# Frequent Urination

## Why it happens
Increased blood volume means your kidneys process more fluid, and your growing uterus is starting to put pressure on your bladder.

## When to call your doctor
If urination is painful, burning, cloudy, or accompanied by fever, as this could indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI).
